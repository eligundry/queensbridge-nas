# queensbridge-nas

I have a network attached storage (NAS) device and I live in Queens so, it's
fitting that the naming conventions around this device reference the legendary
Nasir Jones AKA Nas!

The repository contains configurations for Docker containers running on this
device. I'm primarily using it to backup my computer via Time Machine and as
a torrent powered Tivo device through Plex. All access goes through Tailscale.
